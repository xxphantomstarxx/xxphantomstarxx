Hello! I'm xxphantomstarxx and if you're reading this, you probably found me on Ponytown!
I have a lot of ponies made for a lot of fandoms and I really don't care if you get inspired as long as you don't directly copy.
I'm offtab sometimes and talking in whispers other times. However, if you see me around, feel free to say hello!
Just as a heads up, I'm from the 1990's.

FANDOMS I HAVE PONIES FOR: (not all ponies, however, are fandom-related)
- Gravity Falls
- Silent Hill
- G3 MLP
- Sonic
- Vocaloid + other vocal synths
- Halloween
- My own OCs

I don't have a strict DNI other than no bigots or heavy discoursers of any flavor. Aside from that, I don't really care about your fandoms or whatever and go based off of how you treat people.
I do like horror quite a bit, so if you're bothered by that, you might not get along with me too well.

I'm an artist and game developer working on my own RPG games! I also play games and write on the side.
